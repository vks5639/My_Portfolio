## About me
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/n5Ez0vv.png" width="300" height="400"> 

Hello, I'm Vikash Kumar Singh, currently exploring the intersection of technology and business as I pursue my Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. My academic endeavors are grounded in a broad spectrum of coursework including Database Management, Data-Focused Python, Statistics and Probability, A/B Testing, Telling Stories with Data and more.

I currently enhance my practical experience as a Data Analyst at Sustainible, where I manage extensive datasets to aid entrepreneurs in refining their business models. This role, along with my teaching assistantship in Database Management, underscores my passion for applying analytical acumen and technical expertise to solve real-world problems and drive innovation. My professional path has taken me from Infosys Limited, where I contributed significantly as a Test Analyst and Engineer, to impactful academic projects at Carnegie Mellon University. These projects have not only honed my technical skills in Python, Java, and data analytics but also cultivated my expertise in data visualization, cloud-based solutions, and AI-driven technologies.

I thrive in roles that challenge me to leverage my analytical skills and technical knowledge to solve complex problems and drive innovation. I'm keen to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, professionals, and innovators who are passionate about using technology to drive positive change. Let's explore how we can collaborate to create impactful solutions.

## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of projects with brief descriptions.
### Analyzing COVID RNA Sequences
**Description:** In this project, I delve into the RNA sequences of COVID, focusing on two significant variants: Delta and Omicron. RNA, a vital nucleic acid, serves as the genetic blueprint for COVID, facilitating its cellular entry and replication. By leveraging data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I dissect the metadata for each COVID RNA sequence to unravel insights into these variants.<br>
**Code:** [covid_genome](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/covid_genome.ipynb) <br>
**Original dataset:** [ncbi_datasets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S2ZDjdRkY78kZxBtc9YNUh0mByTHXQ23/view) <br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data vizualization, presentations<br>
**Hard skills:** MS PowerPoint, Python: Pandas, NumPy, Mathplotlib, Seaborn. <br>
**Results:** Identified exact mutation points by finding alignments and mismatches between any two RNA sequences. Color coding resulted in visually differentiating alignments from mismatches, such as insertions, deletions, and substitutions, making it easier to interpret and analyze genetic variations.

### Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94
**Description:** In this analysis, we'll examine data related to traffic heading west on the I-94 Interstate. Our objective is to identify several factors that contribute to congestion on I-94. Potential factors include weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week, among others. <br>
**Code:** [I-94 Traffic](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/i94traffic.ipynb) <br>
**Original dataset:** [Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv) <br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data vizualization.<br>
**Hard skills:** Excel, Pivot Tables, Formulas, Functions, Charts, Dashboards, Slices, Pivot Charts.<br>
**Results:** In this project, my aim was to identify indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. Through the analysis, I identified two main types of indicators:
* Time Indicators:
   * Traffic tends to be heavier during warm months (March–October) in contrast to cold months (November–February).
   * Heavy traffic is typically observed on business days compared to weekends.
   * Rush hours on business days usually occur around 7 AM and 4 PM.
* Weather Indicators:
   * Heavy traffic is associated with specific weather conditions, including shower snow, light rain, and snow, and proximity thunderstorms with drizzle.
   * These findings provide valuable insights into the factors influencing traffic patterns on the I-94 Interstate highway.
   * Understanding these indicators can aid in traffic management and infrastructure planning to improve overall transportation efficiency and safety. <br>

### Exploring Financial Data using Nasdaq Data Link API 
**Description:** As part of the project, I utilized Python to extract and clean financial data from the Nasdaq API, conducted trend analysis and comparative studies on metrics such as Accrued Expenses Turnover, and employed Matplotlib to create visualizations for effective presentation of findings, enabling a comprehensive exploration of financial data. <br>
**Code:** [Exploring Financial Data](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/Exploring%20Financial%20Data%20using%20Nasdaq%20Data%20Link%20API.ipynb) <br>
**Original dataset:** [nasdaq_data](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/nasdaq_data.csv) <br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data vizualization<br>
**Hard skills:** Python, Pandas, SQL, Excel <br>
**Results:** 
* Data Extraction & Analysis:
  * Leveraged Python to extract and clean financial data from Nasdaq API.
  * Conducted trend analysis and comparative studies on metrics like Accrued Expenses Turnover.
* Visualization:
  * Utilized Matplotlib to create visualizations, facilitating effective presentation of findings.
* Conclusion:
  * Enabled a detailed exploration of financial data, empowering insights into companies' performance over time. <br>

### Analyzing Startup Fundraising Deals from Crunchbase

Leveraging the techniques acquired in pandas, I thoroughly explored the dataset to unravel trends, patterns, and noteworthy observations within the realm of startup financing. This endeavor not only honed my skills in data analysis but also provided valuable insights into the dynamics of fundraising rounds in the startup ecosystem. <br>
**Code:** [crunchbase](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/crunchbase.ipynb) <br>
**Original dataset:** [crunchbase_investments](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/crunchbase-investments.csv) <br>
