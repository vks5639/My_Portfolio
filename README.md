## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of projects with brief descriptions.
### Analyzing COVID RNA Sequences
**Description:** In this project, I delve into the RNA sequences of COVID, focusing on two significant variants: Delta and Omicron. RNA, a vital nucleic acid, serves as the genetic blueprint for COVID, facilitating its cellular entry and replication. By leveraging data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I dissect the metadata for each COVID RNA sequence to unravel insights into these variants.<br>
**Code:** [covid_genome](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Projects/covid_genome.ipynb) <br>
**Original dataset:** [ncbi_datasets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S2ZDjdRkY78kZxBtc9YNUh0mByTHXQ23/view) <br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data vizualization, presentations<br>
**Hard skills:** MS PowerPoint, Python: Pandas, NumPy, Mathplotlib, Seaborn. <br>
**Results:** Identified exact mutation points by finding alignments and mismatches between any two RNA sequences. Color coding resulted in visually differentiating alignments from mismatches, such as insertions, deletions, and substitutions, making it easier to interpret and analyze genetic variations.

### Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94
**Description:** In this analysis, we'll examine data related to traffic heading west on the I-94 Interstate. Our objective is to identify several factors that contribute to congestion on I-94. Potential factors include weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week, among others. <br>

**Hard skills:** Excel, Pivot Tables, Formulas, Functions, Charts, Dashboards, Slices, Pivot Charts.<br>
**Results:** In this project, my aim was to identify indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. Through the analysis, I identified two main types of indicators:
* Time Indicators:
   * Traffic tends to be heavier during warm months (March–October) in contrast to cold months (November–February).
   * Heavy traffic is typically observed on business days compared to weekends.
   * Rush hours on business days usually occur around 7 AM and 4 PM.
* Weather Indicators:
   * Heavy traffic is associated with specific weather conditions, including shower snow, light rain, and snow, and proximity thunderstorms with drizzle.
   * These findings provide valuable insights into the factors influencing traffic patterns on the I-94 Interstate highway.
   * Understanding these indicators can aid in traffic management and infrastructure planning to improve overall transportation efficiency and safety. <br>
