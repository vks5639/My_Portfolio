## About me
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/n5Ez0vv.png" width="300" height="400"> 

Hello, I'm Vikash Kumar Singh, currently exploring the intersection of technology and business as I pursue my Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. My academic journey has been rich with diverse coursework ranging from Data Analytics and Statistics to Object-Oriented Programming and A/B Testing.

My professional path has taken me from Infosys Limited, where I contributed significantly as a Test Analyst and Engineer, to impactful academic projects at Carnegie Mellon University. These projects have not only honed my technical skills in Python, Java, and data analytics but also cultivated my expertise in data visualization, cloud-based solutions, and AI-driven technologies.

I thrive in roles that challenge me to leverage my analytical skills and technical knowledge to solve complex problems and drive innovation. Through roles in quality assurance and test engineering, I've developed a keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence, enabling significant improvements in project outcomes and operational efficiency.

I'm keen to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, professionals, and innovators who are passionate about using technology to drive positive change. Let's explore how we can collaborate to create impactful solutions.

For more information please check my [**Resume**](https://github.com/vks5639/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Vikash_Resume.pdf).

This repository was created to showcase my analytical and technical skills (Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, PowerPoint, and others).

## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of projects with brief descriptions.
### Analyzing COVID RNA Sequences
**Description:** In this project, I delve into the RNA sequences of COVID, focusing on two significant variants: Delta and Omicron. RNA, a vital nucleic acid, serves as the genetic blueprint for COVID, facilitating its cellular entry and replication. By leveraging data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I dissect the metadata for each COVID RNA sequence to unravel insights into these variants.<br>

  <code>german-cars-dataset.csv</code></a><br>
**Skills:** analytical thinking, data cleaning, data analysis, data vizualization, presentations<br>
**Hard skills:** MS PowerPoint, Python: Pandas, NumPy, Mathplotlib, Seaborn. <br>
**Results:** Enhanced clarity for identifying sequence alignments and mismatch types. Facilitated comprehensive analysis of COVID RNA variants.
### Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94
**Description:** The goal of this project is to use Excel functionality to analyze data about Adidas's product sales in the United States, which contain information in 9652 rows and 14 columns for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Visualize data, prepare different types of reports and interactive dashboard. <br>
